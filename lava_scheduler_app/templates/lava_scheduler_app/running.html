    <p>A submitted test job involves devices being reserved before the job is set to running,
    so the number of active devices can exceed the number of running jobs. Multinode jobs,
    in particular, may spend an appreciable amount of time as submitted jobs with reserved
    devices. Those devices still count as active as these are not available to be assigned
    to other submitted jobs.</p>

  <div class="alert alert-info">
    <p>Some device-types show up in this table but there are <strong>no devices of this device
    type which are not retired</strong>. Administrators can choose to not display these device-types
    by unsetting the "Display" option in the admin interface.</p>
