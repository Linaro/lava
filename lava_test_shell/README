This directory contains support scripts for lava-test-shell.

The scripts in this directory will be copied into the target device and will be
in $PATH during the lava-test-shell execution.

Distribution-specific scripts can be placed in distro/$distroname, and will
override the ones in the top level directory. For example,
distro/android/lava-test-runner will be used on Android instead of the
lava-test-runner script present at the same directory as this README file.

All scripts have to be named using a "lava-" suffix.
