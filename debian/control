Description: Linaro Automated Validation Architecture dispatcher
 LAVA is a continuous integration system for deploying operating
 systems onto physical and virtual hardware for running tests.
 Tests can be simple boot testing, bootloader testing and system
 level testing, although extra hardware may be required for some
 system tests. Results are tracked over time and data can be
 exported for further analysis.
 .
 This package provides lava-dispatcher to dispatch
 LAVA jobs to configured devices, for Python3 only.
 .
 A range of devices are supported for ARM and
 x86 architectures.

Description: Linaro Automated Validation Architecture server
 LAVA is a continuous integration system for deploying operating
 systems onto physical and virtual hardware for running tests.
 Tests can be simple boot testing, bootloader testing and system
 level testing. Extra hardware may be required for some
 system tests. Results are tracked over time and data can be
 exported for further analysis.
 .
 This package provides the Apache and WSGI configuration and LAVA
 support files to run the validation server on the local Apache
 instance as a lava-server virtual host as well as the scheduler
 and dispatcher.
 .
 This package no longer supports configuration as a
 remote worker and needs to be removed from existing workers.
 Workers must only install lava-dispatcher.
 .
 This package no longer supports Python2.
