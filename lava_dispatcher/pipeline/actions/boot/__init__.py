    Base class for all actions which control power-on
    and boot behaviour of a device under test.
    The subclass selected to do the work will be the
    subclass returning True in the accepts(device_type, image)
    function.
    Each new subclass needs a unit test to ensure it is
    reliably selected for the correct job and not
    selected for an invalid job or a job
    accepted by a different subclass.

    Boot and Test are closely related - a fail error in Boot
    will cause subsequent Test actions to be skipped.
