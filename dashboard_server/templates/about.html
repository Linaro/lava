<h2>About Dashboard Bundles</h2>
<p>Bundle is a document format defined by Launch Control. It is designed to
store test results and the context in which the test was running (such as
hardware used and software installed)</p>

<p>Informally the document can store the results (and context) of running any
amount of test collections (test suites) composed of any number of test cases.
Each test result has one of the pre-defined outcomes (success, failure, skip
and unknown). In addition a test case can measure some property and store a numeric
value along with the test. This makes it possible to store benchmark
information alongside traditional pass/fail tests. The context is stored once
for each test run. This makes it possible to combine multiple bundles into one
bigger document (you could store your entire test history in one file if you
really wanted to). The context is defined as a collection of hardware devices
and software packages. The definition is flexible enough to be applicable to
any operating system and hardware architecture.</p> 

<h3>Bundle Schema</h3>
<p>The bundle is a <a href="http://json.org">JSON</a> document. It is a text
file that can be edited manually, indexed, grepped and managed using familiar
tools. The document has a certain structure defined by a <a
  href="http://json-schema.org">JSON schema</a>. The schema was designed by
several engineers working for the <a href="http://linaro.org">Linaro
  organization</a>. You can download JSON schema for <a
