# Configuration example
# Each dispatcher might have a configuration file like this one.
# Use the fully qualified hostname of the worker as the filename,
# as shown in the lava-server logs, and create the file in
# /etc/lava-server/dispatcher.d on the *server*.

# Dispatcher tmp directory
#dispatcher_download_dir: /var/lib/lava/dispatcher/tmp

# Only set this key, if this dispatcher has many IPs
#dispatcher_ip: <this-dispatcher-ip>

# Only set this key, if this dispatcher is running separately from worker httpd
# server or listening on a custom port.
#dispatcher_http_ip: <dispatcher-http-ip>:<port>

# Only set this key, if this dispatcher is running separately from nfs server
# or listening on a custom port.
#dispatcher_nfs_ip: <dispatcher-nfs-ip>:<port>

# Only set this key, if this dispatcher is running separately from tftpd server
# or listening on a custom port.
#dispatcher_tftp_ip: <dispatcher-tftp-ip>:<port>

# Prefix for all temporary directories
# If this variable is set, the temporary files will be created in
# /var/lib/lava/dispatcher/tmp/<prefix><job_id> instead of
# /var/lib/lava/dispatcher/tmp/<job_id>
#prefix: <prefix>

# Set this variable when using http caching service based on url substitution
# like KissCache
# When downloading resources, lava dispatcher will use this formatting string
# instead of the original url.
#http_url_format_string: "https://cache.lavasoftware.org/api/v1/fetch/?url=%s"

# Set this variable to automatically fallback to the original url if the
# caching service returns an error.
#http_cache_fallback_origin_url: True

# Set additional http cache rules to include/exclude urls for caching.
# if http_cache_include_rules specified, only matched urls will use cache even
# cache service enabled
# if http_cache_exclude_rules specified, matched urls will be skipped even cache
# service enabled
#http_cache_include_rules: ["https://.*nxrm.com"]
#http_cache_exclude_rules: ["https://10.*"]

# Directories to be bind mounted in test actions that run with docker.
# Must be an array with exactly two/three items:
# 1st item: the source directory in the host (mandatory)
# 2nd item: the destination directory in the container (mandatory)
# 3rd item: bind mount mode (optional)
#           default is read-only if this item omitted
#           set as "rw" could make the directory in container writeable
#test_docker_bind_mounts:
#- [<bind-mount1-host-path>, <bind-mount1-container-path>]
#- [<bind-mount2-host-path>, <bind-mount2-container-path>, "rw"]
