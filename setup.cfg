  LAVA is a continuous integration system for deploying operating
  systems onto physical and virtual hardware for running tests.
  Tests can be simple boot testing, bootloader testing and system
  level testing. Extra hardware may be required for some
  system tests. Results are tracked over time and data can be
  exported for further analysis.
