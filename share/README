Template data for lava-server
=============================

To make it easier to setup devices automatically, templates
can be generated from a working instance and then populated
with data from scripts to create JSON files suitable for use
with the south loaddata instructions.

add_device.py reads the definition of a Device and a DeviceType
from lava_scheduler_app.models and genericizes the data to reset
fields to default and provide placeholders for scripts to replace
with user-specified data like the hostname and device type name.

Optionally, add_device.py can also read the definition of a BundleStream
from dashboard_app.models and convert the data to create a default
anonymous lab-health bundle stream if no bundle streams exist on this
instance. Subsequent bundle streams should be created by individual
users with lava-tool as normal.

The objective is to be able to script the initial setup of a LAVA
install to provide enough support to run TestJob 1 without errors.
However, many devices will need small changes to the device configuration
files generated by add_device.py. This is not supported currently.

Jinja2 support in the new dispatcher
====================================

The new dispatcher removes the need for device configuration on the
dispatcher itself, all device configuration occurs through entries in
the database on the master scheduler and templates which assert the
defaults and overrides.

In time, these templates will move into a separate binary package so
that templates can be updated more easily. It is also possible that
override directories can be supported.

The files in the 'devices' directory are examples which will be used
in development and to provide a way to add devices for the new
dispatcher.

Developer builds
================

debian-dev-build.sh is a simple wrapper to build ad-hoc packages for
developers to test their local changes. Packages built from the release
branch would use the tag name alone - note that normally release branch
builds will be done by Debian maintainers from official tarballs released
by Linaro. Packages built from personal branches or the master branch
will use the most recent tag name and have a suffix specifying the short
git hash of the most recent commit on that branch. (This may be the same
as the hash of the commit merged into the release branch to create the
tag.)

Developer builds need various Debian/Ubuntu package tools installed:

$ sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev
$ sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install devscripts

The lava-server build-dependencies also need to be installed - these
change from time to time but debian-dev-build.sh will check
dpkg-checkbuilddeps and halt and detail any build-dependencies not
already installed.

A log of the Debian package build will be placed alongside the
packages.

The Debian packaging for lava-server and lava-dispatcher are
available at http://github.com/Linaro/

Building KVM images for LAVA
============================

 git clone git://git.linaro.org/lava/lava-vmdebootstrap.git

lava-vmdebootstrap is just a small wrapper around
[vmdebootstrap](https://gitorious.org/vmdebootstrap) which does all the hard
work. What lava-vmdebootstrap does is download the Linaro image overlays
and pass some options that we will always need so that you don't need to.

Example invocation::

 $ sudo ./lava-vmdebootstrap --image=myimage.img

To run the test image, make sure it is writeable:

 $ sudo chmod a+w ./myimage.img

Execute using qemu, e.g. on amd64 using qemu-system-x86_64:

 $ qemu-system-x86_64 ./myimage.img

See vmdebootstrap(1)

Once the overlay packages have been downloaded, you can call vmdebootstrap
directly to create other types of images without needing to modify
lava-vmdebootstrap. e.g. this is a call to vmdebootstrap to create a
KVM image based on Ubuntu:

 sudo vmdebootstrap \
  --custom-package='linaro-overlay_1112.2_all.deb' \
  --custom-package='linaro-overlay-minimal_1112.2_all.deb' \
  --enable-dhcp --no-kernel --package=linux-image \
  --serial-console --serial-console-command='/bin/auto-serial-console' \
  --root-password='root' --hostname='ubuntu' --user=linaro/linaro --sudo \
  --verbose --image=myimage.img

This command extends lava-vmdebootstrap to make a 4G image based on
Debian testing using the UK Debian mirror:

 sudo vmdebootstrap \
  --custom-package='linaro-overlay_1112.2_all.deb' \
  --custom-package='linaro-overlay-minimal_1112.2_all.deb' \
  --enable-dhcp \
  --serial-console --serial-console-command='/bin/auto-serial-console' \
  --root-password='root' \
  --distribution testing --size 4g \
  --mirror http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian \
  --verbose --image=myimage.img
