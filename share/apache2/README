Apache config only for pipeline workers
=======================================

LAVA V2 workers just have lava-dispatcher installed, so unless a usable
localhost website is available, retrieving files within the dispatcher can
fail.

This is a section of the lava-server apache config, adapted just for
lava-dispatcher installations.

sudo cp share/apache2/lava-dispatcher.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/
sudo a2ensite lava-dispatcher
sudo a2dissite 000-default

Note: not all V2 workers need a localhost server as long as TFTP is working but
it can be useful for persistent NFS.

If the DocumentRoot and Alias need to be changed in the localhost
configuration, the value in DISPATCHER_DOWNLOAD_DIR also needs to be changed in
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/lava_dispatcher/utils/constants.py

(Support for reading constants independently of the packaged code is pending.)
