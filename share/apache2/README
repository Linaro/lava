Apache config only for pipeline workers
=======================================

LAVA V1 workers have a lava-server configuration
to provide the apache configuration. LAVA V2 workers
just have lava-dispatcher installed, so unless a
usable localhost website is available, retrieving
files within the dispatcher can fail.

This is a section of the lava-server apache config,
adapted just for lava-dispatcher installations.

sudo cp share/apache2/lava-dispatcher.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/
sudo a2ensite lava-dispatcher
sudo a2dissite 000-default

Note: not all V2 workers need a localhost server
as long as TFTP is working but it can be useful
for persistent NFS.

If the DocumentRoot and Alias need to be changed
in the localhost configuration, the value in
DISPATCHER_DOWNLOAD_DIR
also needs to be changed in
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/lava_dispatcher/pipeline/utils/constants.py

(Support for reading constants independently of the
packaged code is pending.)
