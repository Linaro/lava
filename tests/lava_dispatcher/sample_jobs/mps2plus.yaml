# MPS2+ Firmware is not readily available for download.
# The firmware is available for download off a page here:
# https://developer.arm.com/products/system-design/development-boards/fpga-prototyping-boards/download-fpga-images
# HOWEVER:
# - The zips are behind a click-through licence
# - The zips often contain the firmware in a folder inside that zip. E.g.
#   at time of writing, Cortex-M23_IoT_kit_3_0.zip contains the contents of the recovery.zip
#   at /IoT23-3-0/boards/Recovery/ inside the zip. This will have to be extracted, rezipped
#   into a correct format and then hosted somewhere for download for LAVA to use.
#
# Therefore this sample job will not work, the firmware url will have to be changed.
